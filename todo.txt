short term:
- base input class
- any way to increase font size?
- any way to make text center?
- find a better folder structure
- combine item and sprite repositories into a class
- change interaction signal to be terminatable
- create exit game signal
- if options get too long create a scrollable container by drawing to a new surface, turning it into a sprite and then drawing it onto the real surface.
- make elements in containers have relative positions
- move interaction signals to objects instead of being global
- allow each animation to set their own speed
- find a way to reverse keys (do executions inside key input and add an undo function to the commands)
- reset items on potion creation

todo for mvp:
- keyboard input handling (done)
- ability to render multiple screens (done)
- ability to stack screens on top of each other (done)
- player character that can move and interact with objects (done)
- event based architecture? (done)

nice to haves:
- sound
- options menu (key rebinding?, volume mixer)
- i11n (english, dutch, indonesian?)
- mouse events (click (done), drag (done), move (done), hover)
- title menu (done)

assumptions made:
- Everything collision and interaction wise assumes there will only ever be 1 dynamic collider

what would i do different next time:
- i would like to try an entity component system next time with less inheritance and more composition
- i would like more signals to be inside classes instead of global
- probably find better ways to do texture ordering
- per screen input mapping?
