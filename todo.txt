short term:
- base input class
- any way to increase font size?
- combine item and sprite repositories into a class
- change interaction signal to be terminatable
- create exit game signal
- if options get too long create a scrollable container by drawing to a new surface, turning it into a sprite and then drawing it onto the real surface.
- make elements in containers have relative positions
- move interaction signals to objects instead of being global
- maybe rewrite parts of template to look a bit better?
- too much gap in first row of inventory. fix later.
- change animation to sprite instead of in spriteStack and remove unnecisary spriteStacks
- try seperating logic from ui more
- add success and fail into set and add functions?
- add a text class to template for font sizes and text centering
- switch over to systems (animation system, movement system, physics system)
- turning sprites into classes that have a surface inside of them and take a rect
- replace std string in file operations with path
- create is point in bounds function for bounding boxes

todo for mvp:
- keyboard input handling (done)
- ability to render multiple screens (done)
- ability to stack screens on top of each other (done)
- player character that can move and interact with objects (done)
- event based architecture? (done)
- camera (done)

developing further:
- customers
- husbandry
	- have creatures
	- creatures are put in pens
	- pens can be bought slime rancher style (i.e see plot, buy and choose type)
	- creatures can have their item harvested on a timer
	- pens/creature can be leveled for faster production or better items?
	- have upgrade list for what should happen at each level
- saving system
- plant and crystal growing
- storage
	- add bought animals to storage screen with tabs
- market and money

nice to haves:
- sound
- options menu (key rebinding?, volume mixer)
- i11n (english, dutch, indonesian?)
- mouse events (click (done), drag (done), move (done), hover)
- title menu (done)

assumptions made:
- Everything collision and interaction wise assumes there will only ever be 1 dynamic collider

what would i do different next time:
- i would like to try an entity component system next time with less inheritance and more composition
- i would like more signals to be inside classes instead of global
- probably find better ways to do texture ordering
