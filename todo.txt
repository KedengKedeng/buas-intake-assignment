short term:
- unsubscribe function in signals
- any way to increase font size?
- any way to make text center?

todo for mvp:
- keyboard input handling (done)
- ability to render multiple screens (should be done?)
- ability to stack screens on top of each other
- player character that can move and interact with objects
- event based architecture?

nice to haves:
- sound
- options menu (key rebinding?, volume mixer)
- i11n (english, dutch, indonesian?)
- mouse events (click and drag)
- title menu

implementation details to keep in mind:
- we need a signal class for links between objects and events
- in case keyboard rebinding is added we should use the command pattern
