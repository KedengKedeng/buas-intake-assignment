short term:
- base input class
- any way to increase font size?
- any way to make text center?
- find a better folder structure
- combine item and sprite repositories into a class
- allow stacking of screens (use a stack?)
- allow interacting with cauldron which changes screens while not throwing in items
- change interaction signal to be terminatable
- turn all Tmpl8::vec2 in constructors into references
- move surface and surface operations like clear outside of screens and into tick function
- create exit game signal
- if options get too long create a scrollable container by drawing to a new surface, turning it into a sprite and then drawing it onto the real surface.

todo for mvp:
- keyboard input handling (done)
- ability to render multiple screens (done)
- ability to stack screens on top of each other
- player character that can move and interact with objects
- event based architecture?

nice to haves:
- sound
- options menu (key rebinding?, volume mixer)
- i11n (english, dutch, indonesian?)
- mouse events (click and drag)
- title menu

implementation details to keep in mind:
- we need a signal class for links between objects and events
- in case keyboard rebinding is added we should use the command pattern
